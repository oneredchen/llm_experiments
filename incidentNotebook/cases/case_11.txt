On August 23, 2025, a highly targeted spear-phishing campaign was launched against the finance department. An employee received an email, seemingly from the IT department, with the subject line "Action Required: Your network password will expire in 24 hours". The email contained a link that the user was instructed to click to reset their password. The link, which pointed to 'http://your-company-portal.com/reset-password', was a look-alike domain, designed to mimic the company's actual password reset portal. The user, believing the email to be legitimate, clicked the link and entered their current network credentials, which were then harvested by the attacker.

The attacker, now in possession of valid credentials, logged into the employee's email account from the IP address '10.1.1.15'. From there, they sent out additional phishing emails to other employees in the finance department, hoping to compromise more accounts. The attacker also created a forwarding rule in the compromised account to send a copy of all incoming and outgoing emails to an external email address, 'exfil-data@protonmail.com'. This allowed the attacker to monitor the employee's communications and gather more information about the company's financial operations.
