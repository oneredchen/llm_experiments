A user reported on August 22, 2025, that they were having trouble accessing a legitimate e-commerce website. When they tried to navigate to the site, they were redirected to a different page that looked identical to the real login page. The user became suspicious and did not enter their credentials. Our security team investigated the issue and discovered a man-in-the-middle attack was being carried out on our corporate guest network. The attacker had set up a rogue access point with the SSID 'Free-WiFi' and was using it to intercept and redirect the user's traffic. The attacker was also using a self-signed SSL certificate to decrypt the user's traffic.
