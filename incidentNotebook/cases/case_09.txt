On August 22, 2025, our organization was the victim of a sophisticated cyberattack that utilized a previously unknown zero-day exploit. The exploit targeted a vulnerability in our enterprise email server software, allowing the attackers to gain remote code execution on the server with system-level privileges. The attackers then used this access to install a persistent backdoor on the server, which they used to maintain access to our network. The attackers also moved laterally to other systems on the network and exfiltrated a large amount of sensitive data. The zero-day exploit was later patched by the vendor, but not before significant damage had been done.
