On August 23, 2025, our company's network was hit by a massive denial-of-service (DoS) attack that brought our external-facing services to a standstill. The attack, which lasted for several hours, flooded our network with a large amount of malicious traffic, overwhelming our firewalls and other security devices. Our security team, with the help of our ISP, was able to trace the source of the attack to a large botnet of compromised Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

The botnet, which was a variant of the infamous Mirai botnet, consisted of thousands of compromised IoT devices, such as webcams, DVRs, and smart home devices. The attackers had been able to compromise these devices by scanning the internet for devices that were still using their default factory passwords. The attackers then used the compromised devices to launch a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack against our network. The attack was launched from a command and control server located at the IP address '192.0.2.200'.
