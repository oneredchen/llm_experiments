Our security team was alerted to a potential web server compromise on August 22, 2025, after our file integrity monitoring system detected an unauthorized change to the web server's file system. An investigation revealed that an attacker had successfully exploited a critical vulnerability in the 'ExampleCMS' web application that was running on our server, 'www.example.com'. The attacker uploaded a web shell named 'shell.php' to the server, which gave them the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the server. The attacker then used the web shell to create a new user account with the username 'hacker' and escalate their privileges to root.
