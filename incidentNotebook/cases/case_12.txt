A user was browsing a popular industry news website on August 23, 2025, when their machine became infected with malware. The website had been compromised by an attacker who had injected a malicious script into the site's code. The script exploited a zero-day vulnerability in the user's web browser, allowing it to silently download and execute a malware payload without the user's knowledge or consent. The user did not notice anything unusual at the time, as the malware was designed to be as stealthy as possible.

The malware, which was later identified as 'adware-installer.exe', began to exhibit a variety of malicious behaviors. It started by displaying intrusive pop-up advertisements on the user's screen, many of which were for other malicious software. The malware also hijacked the user's web browser, redirecting their traffic to other malicious websites. To ensure its persistence, the malware created a scheduled task that would execute the malware every time the user logged into their machine. The SHA256 hash of the malware was determined to be '234bcd567efa890ghi123jkl456mno789pqr012stu345vwx678yz9'.
