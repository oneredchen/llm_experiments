During a routine analysis of our network traffic on August 22, 2025, our security analysts noticed an unusually high volume of DNS queries to a suspicious domain, 'data-exfil.bad-actor.net'. Further investigation revealed that the DNS queries were not legitimate and were in fact being used to exfiltrate data from our network. The source of the queries was a host on our internal network, 'infected-pc-01', which had been compromised by malware. The malware was encoding the exfiltrated data into the DNS queries and sending them to the attacker-controlled domain. This technique, known as DNS tunneling, is often used by attackers to bypass firewalls and other security controls.
