On August 23, 2025, our company fell victim to a business email compromise (BEC) attack that resulted in a significant financial loss. The attacker, through a separate phishing campaign, had gained access to the email account of our CEO. The attacker then spent several weeks monitoring the CEO's email communications to learn about the company's business practices, communication style, and financial procedures. The attacker also identified a key employee in the finance department who was responsible for processing wire transfers.

The attacker then sent a carefully crafted email to the finance employee, spoofing the CEO's email address. The email, which was sent at the end of the business day on a Friday, requested an urgent wire transfer of $50,000 to a new vendor for a time-sensitive acquisition. The email used the same language and tone as the CEO's previous emails, and it even included the CEO's email signature. The finance employee, believing the request to be legitimate, processed the wire transfer to the bank account provided by the attacker. The fraud was not discovered until the following week, by which time the money was long gone.
