We are currently in the midst of a long-term investigation into an advanced persistent threat (APT) actor that has been targeting our organization for several months. The attackers have demonstrated a high level of sophistication and have used a variety of advanced techniques to gain and maintain access to our network. The initial intrusion vector is believed to have been a spear-phishing campaign that targeted high-level executives. The attackers have since used a combination of custom malware, living-off-the-land techniques, and stolen credentials to move laterally throughout our network and exfiltrate a large amount of sensitive data. The investigation is ongoing, and we are working with law enforcement and third-party security experts to remediate the incident.
