A security researcher discovered a critical security vulnerability in our cloud infrastructure on August 23, 2025. The researcher found a publicly accessible Amazon S3 bucket that contained a large amount of sensitive company data. The S3 bucket, which was named 'example-company-data', had been misconfigured to allow public access, meaning that anyone on the internet could access its contents. The bucket contained a wide variety of sensitive data, including customer records, internal financial documents, employee PII, and even the source code for some of our proprietary applications.

The researcher downloaded a sample of the data to verify the contents and then immediately reported the issue to our security team. We were able to secure the S3 bucket within minutes of receiving the report, but not before the data had been exposed for an unknown period of time. We are now in the process of investigating the incident to determine the full extent of the data exposure and to notify any affected customers. We are also reviewing our cloud security policies and procedures to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.
