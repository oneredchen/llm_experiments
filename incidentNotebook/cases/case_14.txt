Our e-commerce website, 'shop.example.com', was the victim of a major data breach on August 23, 2025. The attacker was able to gain unauthorized access to our customer database by exploiting a SQL injection vulnerability in the website's login page. The attacker used a popular open-source tool called 'sqlmap' to automate the process of finding and exploiting the vulnerability. The attacker was then able to bypass the login authentication and execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database.

The attacker proceeded to exfiltrate the entire customer database, which contained the personal and financial information of over 100,000 customers. The exfiltrated data included customer names, home addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and encrypted credit card numbers. The attacker later posted a sample of the stolen data on a public pastebin site, 'pastebin.com/raw/12345678', and threatened to release the rest of the data if a ransom was not paid. The attack was traced back to an IP address, '203.0.113.78', which was later found to be part of a botnet.
