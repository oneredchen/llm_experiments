On August 22, 2025, a user in the marketing department reported a suspicious email that they had received earlier that day. The email, with the subject line 'Urgent Account Verification Required', appeared to be from the company's IT department. The sender's email address, however, was 'badguy@evil.com', which is not a legitimate company domain. The email body urged the user to click on a link to prevent their account from being suspended. The link, 'http://fake-login-page.com/update-credentials', directed the user to a web page that was designed to look like the company's real login page. The user did not enter their credentials and instead reported the email to the security team.
