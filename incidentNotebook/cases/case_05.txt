A routine audit of our file server logs on August 22, 2025, revealed a large and unusual amount of data being accessed and copied from a sensitive project folder. The investigation traced the activity back to a user account belonging to a disgruntled employee, 'disgruntled_employee'. The logs showed that the employee had connected to the file server from their assigned workstation, 'EMP-WS-007', and had copied several gigabytes of data to an external USB drive. The employee had recently been passed over for a promotion and had expressed their dissatisfaction to several colleagues. This incident is being treated as a potential case of intellectual property theft.
