On August 23, 2025, our security team uncovered a sophisticated watering hole attack that had been targeting our employees for several weeks. The attackers had compromised a third-party website that is frequently visited by our employees for work-related purposes. The attackers had injected a malicious script into the website's code that was designed to only execute if the visitor's IP address was within our company's public IP address range. This made the attack difficult to detect, as it would not be triggered by security researchers or other external visitors.

The malicious script would first check the user's browser and operating system for a specific version of Adobe Flash Player that was known to be vulnerable. If the vulnerable version was detected, the script would then exploit the vulnerability to install a remote access trojan (RAT) on the user's machine. The RAT, a variant of the Gh0st RAT, would then connect to a command and control server at the IP address '192.0.2.100' on TCP port '8080'. The RAT gave the attackers complete control over the infected machine, allowing them to steal data, install additional malware, and move laterally throughout our network.
