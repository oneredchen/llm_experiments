An employee in our accounting department received a phone call on August 23, 2025, from an individual who claimed to be from our IT help desk. The caller, who was very professional and convincing, told the employee that there was a problem with their computer and that they needed to reset their password. The caller then directed the employee to a website that looked like our company's password reset page and asked them to enter their current password and then a new password. The employee, believing the caller to be legitimate, followed their instructions.

The attacker, now in possession of the employee's new password, logged into their account and began to access sensitive financial data. The attacker also attempted to convince the employee to install a remote access tool on their machine, but the employee became suspicious and hung up the phone. The employee then reported the incident to our security team. An investigation revealed that the attacker had used a vishing (voice phishing) attack to trick the employee into revealing their password. The attacker's phone number was spoofed to look like it was coming from our internal help desk.
