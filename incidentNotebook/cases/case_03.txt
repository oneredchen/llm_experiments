At approximately 3:45 AM on August 22, 2025, our network intrusion detection system (IDS) generated an alert for a potential network intrusion. The alert indicated that an external IP address, '203.0.113.55', was conducting a port scan against our public-facing web server at '198.51.100.10'. The scan targeted a wide range of TCP ports, including common service ports such as 80, 443, and 22. Shortly after the port scan completed, the IDS detected a series of SQL injection attempts originating from the same IP address. The attacks were targeted at the web server's login page and appeared to be an attempt to gain unauthorized access to the web application.
