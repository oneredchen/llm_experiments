On the morning of August 22, 2025, multiple users from various departments began reporting that they were unable to access their files. When they tried to open their documents, they were greeted with a ransomware note that had been placed on their desktops. The note, titled 'Your Files Have Been Encrypted!', demanded a payment of 0.5 Bitcoin to a specified wallet address in exchange for the decryption key. Our security team quickly identified the ransomware as a new variant of the 'CryptoLocker' family. The ransomware process, 'cryptolocker.exe', was found to be communicating with a command and control server located at the Tor hidden service address 'c2.dark-web-domain.onion'.
