An employee in the sales department downloaded a file named 'setup.zip' from a public file-sharing website on August 22, 2025. The employee believed the file to be a legitimate software installer. The zip file contained a single executable file named 'installer.exe', which had a SHA256 hash of '123abc456def789ghi012jkl345mno678pqr901stu234vwx567yz'. Upon execution, the installer appeared to do nothing, but in the background, it dropped a malicious DLL file named 'malicious.dll' into the 'C:\Windows\System32' directory. The DLL is a known malware variant that is used to steal data from infected machines.
