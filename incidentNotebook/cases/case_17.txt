On August 23, 2025, our IT operations team noticed a significant and unexplained increase in CPU usage across several of our production web servers. The high CPU usage was causing performance issues for our customers, and the on-call engineers were unable to identify the root cause. Our security team was called in to investigate, and they quickly discovered that the servers had been infected with cryptojacking malware. The malware was using the servers' CPU resources to mine for the Monero cryptocurrency, which is a popular choice for cryptojackers due to its privacy features.

The investigation revealed that the malware had been introduced into our environment through a third-party JavaScript library that we were using on our website. The library had been compromised by an attacker who had injected a malicious script into its code. The script, which was being served from 'http://cryptominer.com/script.js', was responsible for downloading and executing the cryptojacking malware on our servers. We have since removed the compromised library from our website and have implemented additional security controls to prevent similar attacks in the future.
