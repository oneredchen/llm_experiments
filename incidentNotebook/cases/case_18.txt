Our company was a victim of a sophisticated supply chain attack on August 23, 2025. The attackers targeted a trusted software vendor that we use for a critical business function. The attackers were able to compromise the vendor's software development environment and inject a malicious backdoor into the source code of their software. The vendor, unaware of the compromise, then signed and distributed the malicious software update to its customers, including our company.

When we installed the software update, the backdoor was installed on our systems. The backdoor gave the attackers a persistent foothold in our network, which they used to move laterally and exfiltrate a large amount of sensitive data. The malicious update was for the software 'SuperUtil' version '1.2.3'. The attack was discovered when our security team noticed a large amount of data being exfiltrated to an unknown IP address. We are now working with the software vendor and law enforcement to investigate the incident.
