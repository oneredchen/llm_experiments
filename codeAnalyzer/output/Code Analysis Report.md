**VirusTotal Scanning Tool Analysis**
=====================================

### Overview

The provided codebase consists of three files: `requirements.txt`, `utils.py`, and `main.py`. These files are part of a VirusTotal scanning tool designed to scan IP addresses, URLs, and files using the VirusTotal API.

### Requirements Management
---------------------------

* **File:** `requirements.txt`
* **Functionality:** Dependency management
* **Summary:** This file specifies the required Python packages and their versions for the project. The listed dependencies include:
	+ aiohttp
	+ aiosignal
	+ async-timeout
	+ attrs
	+ autopep8
	+ certifi
	+ charset-normalizer
	+ frozenlist
	+ idna
	+ install
	+ multidict
	+ pycodestyle
	+ requests
	+ toml
	+ urllib3
	+ vt-py (VirusTotal API client)
	+ yarl

### Utility Functions
----------------------

* **File:** `utils.py`
* **Functionality:** Utility functions for scanning IP addresses, URLs, and files
* **Summary:** This file provides utility functions for scanning IP addresses, URLs, and files using the VirusTotal API. The key components include:
	+ Asyncio support for concurrent execution of scans
	+ VirusTotal API client implementation
	+ `ipScan` function for scanning IP addresses
	+ `urlScan` function for scanning URLs
	+ `fileScan` function for scanning files

### Main Entry Point
--------------------

* **File:** `main.py`
* **Functionality:** Entry point for the VirusTotal scanning tool
* **Summary:** This file serves as the main entry point for the VirusTotal scanning tool. It:
	1. Reads input queries from a file named `input.txt`
	2. Categorizes the queries into IP, URL, and File types
	3. Uses the VirusTotal API to scan each query in parallel using asyncio
	4. Utilizes the utility functions implemented in `utils.py` for scanning

### Program Flow
-----------------

1. The program reads input queries from a file named `input.txt`.
2. It categorizes the queries into IP, URL, and File types.
3. For each query type, it uses the corresponding scanning function (e.g., `ipScan`, `urlScan`, or `fileScan`) to scan the query using the VirusTotal API.
4. The program utilizes asyncio for concurrent execution of scans.

### Conclusion
----------

The provided codebase is designed to create a VirusTotal scanning tool that can efficiently scan IP addresses, URLs, and files in parallel using the VirusTotal API. The tool is built on top of Python 3.x and utilizes various libraries for dependency management, async programming, and API interactions.
